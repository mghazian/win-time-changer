1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

    1. Originally this point says "Outright copyright infringement...", but I don't mind, go ahead.
    2. Originally this point says "Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever...", but I don't mind, go ahead.
    3. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, and so on and so on, good for you.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
